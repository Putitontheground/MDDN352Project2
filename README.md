# MDDN352Project2
Project 2 for MDDN 352 at Victoria University

This project allows the use of custom markers and custom models to display a real time AR scene tracked to a point. 
The inteneded use is for a gallery/library/museum to display information in a fun and interactive way. This project utilises
ar.js and aframe to make the realtime AR happen. 

This site allows the use of multiple markers and models which can be assigned to whichever the user desires. I recommend hosting all assets on something like rawgit as it usually doesn't like it when hosted locally.
